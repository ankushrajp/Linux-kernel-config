Symbol : CONFIG_KERNEL_(LZ4 or ZSTD or LZO....) depending on selection

Choice : LZ4

Info   : Among the options given, select an algorithm to be used for Kernel compression.

Gzip provides one of the highest compression but lowest decompression speed.
LZ4 provides lowest compression but fastest decompression speed. 
ZSTD provides compression comparable to Gzip with much faster decompression rate.

For most modern drives, the size of uncompressed linux kernel is already small enough to not matter much for file loading time. Decompression speed is more important. 
Hence, LZ4 is selected.

If you are on a system with very low disk space want to save every MB possible, ZSTD is recommended.
If you compiling for an embedded system and saving space is your only goal, XZ is recommended.
