Symbol : CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS 

Choice : Included

Info   : It is good to include this option if your hardware supports it. It allows system to wakeup and process data at more accurate intervals(although at a cost of increased latency). 
You can exclude it if your hardware doesn't support it or you are sure no application you use uses it.

To check whether hardware supports it or not, you can run below commands from a distribution kernel.
cat /proc/timer_list | grep -m 1 -i .resolution - if value is 1 nsecs, it is supported.
cat /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/available_clocksource - if it displays hpet, it is supported.
