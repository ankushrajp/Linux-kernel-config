Symbol : CONFIG_CPU_ISOLATION 

Choice : Excluded

Info   : CPU allocation to tasks is handled by kernel scheduler and kernel decided which task should run on which cpu. User has no say in it.
But if you want isolate cpu(s) from kernel scheduler and dedicate that cpu(s) to a particular task so that it runs without any disturbance, this option should be included otherwise it can be safely excluded.
