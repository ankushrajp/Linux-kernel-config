Symbol : CONFIG_LOCALVERSION_AUTO

Choice : Excluded

Info   : If you downloaded the source code using git, this option will append, if a git-based tree is found, a unique version control tag in form of "-gxxxxxx". It may be used to differentiate between git-based and not git kernel sources.
For now, CONFIG_LOCALVERSION is enough for our uses.
