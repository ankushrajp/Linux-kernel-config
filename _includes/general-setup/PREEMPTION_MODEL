Symbol : CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE, CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY, CONFIG_PREEMPT 

Choice : Voluntary kernel preemption (CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY)

Info   : Preemptive kernel can be interrupted in the middle of executing code. It means sys-calls do not block the entire system.
If a process takes a long time to finish doesn't mean kernel cannot do anything else in that time.
Voluntary Kernel Preemption is recommended for desktop systems but if you use case requires latency in milliseconds, Preemtible kernel(CONFIG_PREEMPT) option should be selected.
